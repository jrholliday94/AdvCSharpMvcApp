<h2>Robot on the Run</h2>

<p>
    Robot on the Run is a 2d platformer with a story about a poor robot who has crashed his spaceship and lost parts. You play as Cirkit, who at the start of the game, crashes his spaceship on an alien planet.
    In the destruction, Cirkit loses some of his robotic and spaceship parts and must search though the landscape to retreive them and rebuild his body and ship. This unknown planet is full of danger and Cirkit
    must give his all to stay alive!

    So far that isn't official since we really haven't had time to meet. Overall We would like a basic 2d platformer since this is really our first big game. We think we are going to add abilities like double jump 
    when your pick up robot parts if that is the way we are going. At very elast, regular progession through levels rewards the player with abilities. As for score, we plan to have collectibles like coins or something
    along those lines. Time may play a factor in final score like in Super Mario Bros. The 2d platformer game genre is rather saturated, so if we want to make this game stand out, we need to make it interesting.
